# Neural networks for pollen classification

1. Implemented tests on 3 neural networks: LeNet5, Resnet, and AlexNet to classify the pollen grains observed, and analyzed different characteristic of these networks based on their performance for processing pollen images. 
2. In charge of the tests for ResNet and part of LeNet5, which had both been tested on Google collaborative platform with Python and Tensorflow. 
3. Experiment showed that ResNet50 and AlexNet particularly performed good in terms of accuracy. AlexNet is finally a good compromise for pollen classification with the constraint on the computational complexity.
4. Our research enables palynologist to reconstruct the environment for climate change studies based on pollen analysis, and it also contributes to prevention of allergy caused by pollen.
