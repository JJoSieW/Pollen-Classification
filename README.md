# Neural networks for pollen classification

1. Implemented tests on 3 neural networks: LeNet5, Resnet, and AlexNet to classify the pollen grains observed, and analyzed different characteristic of these networks based on their performance for processing pollen images. 
2. In charge of the tests for ResNet and part of LeNet5, which had both been tested on Google collaborative platform with Python and Tensorflow. 
3. Experiment showed that ResNet50 and AlexNet particularly performed good in terms of accuracy. AlexNet is finally a good compromise for pollen classification with the constraint on the computational complexity.
4. Our research enables palynologist to reconstruct the environment for climate change studies based on pollen analysis, and it also contributes to prevention of allergy caused by pollen.


1.	Our group applied 3 neural networks - LeNet5, ResNet50, and AlexNet to the task of pollen classification, using a dataset containing 1200 pollen grain images, and compared their performance.
2.	I was in charge of the experiment of ResNet50 model, which had been tested on Google collaborative platform with Python and TensorFlow, and achieved the accuracy of 96.81% with a training/test ratio of 80/20.
3.	The experiment showed that ResNet50 and AlexNet particularly performed well in terms of accuracy. AlexNet is finally a good compromise for pollen classification with the constraint on the computational complexity.
4.	Our research enabled palynologists to reconstruct the environment for climate change studies based on pollen analysis, and it also contributed to the prevention of allergies caused by pollen.
